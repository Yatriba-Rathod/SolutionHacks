- Pitch: Many young people (students, first-generation grads, marginalized youth) have academic knowledge but lack practical job readiness. They’re unsure about: Resume quality, Realistic career paths, Which skills employers actually want, Interview skills, Where they’re strong or weak. Career centers are great — but they’re underfunded, generic, or inaccessible for millions.
